                Safespace is a venting app designed to help our users cope with the struggles that come up in our everyday lives.
                Inspired by The Wailing Wall in Jerusalum, this is a digital space to work through the heavy thoughts on
                your mind. And to leave them here, taking with you a sense of hope that it will get better if you just keep moving forward.
