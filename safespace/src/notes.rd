This is a safespace. This is not a venting app; this is a healing app. 
This is a safespace for people to be vulnerable and share the things they can't share
with others. One day I hope to incorporate an AI therapist/healer program into this app.
For now, it's a safespace to get all that bs off your chest. It's ok. This is Safespace.


My vision for the first version of this app: I want the input to render on the page as a 
notecard or something like this and then when the user is ready I want them to be able to
digitally burn the image (prehaps there's different variations of this they can choose from:
burning, tear up, break like glass, etc) And once that input is gone, it will return a different
inpirational message each time. I know people are going to abuse this, but I'm not making it for them.
I'm making it for myself and for others who need it.

This app needs to produce a physical catharsis through digital media.
